// In order to convert some functionality to Visual C#, the Java Language Conversion Assistant

// Support classes replicate the functionality of the original code, but in some cases they are 
// substantially different architecturally. Although every effort is made to preserve the 
// original architecture of the application in the converted project, the user should be aware that 
// the primary goal of these support classes is to replicate functionality, and that at times 
// the architecture of the resulting solution may differ somewhat.
